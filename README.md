# Shulgin

## This app is a work in progress. Feel free to browse the code to see how I'm putting things together, but this app is still in the very beginning stages and nowhere near close to being ready. If you'd like to test the app and help me find bugs, you can find a prototype at https://shulgin.io

Drugs are better with friends. Shulgin is an app for tracking your experiences while taking pharmaceutical drugs and sharing your experiences with the world anonymously to identify trends and frequencies of side effects.
